# Send and view memos

When you send ARW, you can optionally send a [memo](../../concepts/memos.md) to the recipient. Similarly, as a recipient of ARW, you can view memos that senders include as part of the transaction.

## Send memos in transactions

1. On the **Send** tab, specify your recipient's address.
1. Click **Memo**. The Memo window is displayed.
1. Add the message in the **Memo** field. Memos are limited to 512 characters.

    !!! Tip
        To enable your recipient to reply to you, click **Include Reply Address**. Your address is added to the **Memo** field.

1. Click **OK**.

## View memos sent to you

1. On the **Transactions** tab, find the transaction with the memo, and hover the cursor over the speech bubble. The speech bubble is the icon for a memo. Alternatively, select the transaction with the memo, and either right-click or press the Control key and click, and then select **View Memo**. The memo is displayed in a pop-up window.
