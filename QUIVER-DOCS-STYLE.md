# Quiver docs style guide

The following guidelines ensure the Quiver docs are consistent, well-organized, easy to understand, and useful.

Not every guideline is currently followed in the Quiver docs. However, when you write new content and revise existing content, you should follow every guideline.

These guidelines are alive, and they will evolve. If you think a different guideline would be better for Quiver users, suggest a style change in a PR.

## General best practices

Aim for these goals:

* Consistency
* Simplicity and accuracy
* Educated support
* Completeness

### Consistency

Be consistent in vocabulary, formatting, and sentence structure.

### Simplicity and accuracy

Speak plainly. Avoid technical jargon. In most cases, assume Quiver users are novices. Ensure the technical details are entirely accurate.

### Educated support

When you write conceptual information, consider the types of questions you as a user might have and seek to answer those questions in the docs. When you write technical procedures, anticipate our users' needs and knowledgeably guide them. Where appropriate, add inline tips, warnings, and examples.

### Completeness

Be thorough without being wordy.

## Writing style guide

Quiver docs generally follow the [IBM developerWorks editorial style guide](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/styleguidelines/).

The goal is to educate people. With this goal in mind, the Quiver docs team aims to write content that exemplifies these characteristics:

* Professional, clear language
* Short, declarative sentences
* Casual and conversational tone

### Important points of style

#### Second person

Use second person ("you") when speaking to or about the reader. Authors can refer to themselves in the first person ("I" in single-author articles or "we" in multiple-author articles) but should keep the focus on the reader.

#### Active voice

Use active voice where possible. If any of the following conditions are true, use passive voice:

* The system performs the action.
* It is more appropriate to focus on the receiver of the action.
* You want to avoid blaming the user for an error, such as in an error message.
* The information is clearer in passive voice.

#### Short words

Short words are better than long words. For example, use "helps" rather than "facilitates" and "uses" rather than "utilizes."

#### Sentence-style capitalization

Use sentence-style capitalization for headings and captions; that is, capitalize only the first letter of the first word and any proper nouns or acronyms.

#### Contractions

Use contractions. They contribute to a casual, informal tone.

#### Recommendations

To make recommendations, use the phrase "we recommend." Don't use "Quiver recommends," "Arrow recommends," or "it is recommended."

#### Abbreviations

Define acronyms and abbreviations on their first occurrence in an article. Thereafter in the article, use only the abbreviation.

#### Lists

Use a complete sentence to introduce a list of items.

**Example**: In a terminal window, complete the following steps.
